# Solving the 8 Queens Problem Using a Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains an AI course project focused on solving the classic 8 Queens problem using a genetic algorithm. The project demonstrates the application of evolutionary techniques to find solutions where 8 queens can be placed on a chessboard without attacking each other.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samer-Ramses/Solving-the-8-Queens-Problem-Using-a-Genetic-Algorithm.git
cd Solving-the-8-Queens-Problem-Using-a-Genetic-Algorithm

## Usage

Open the code.ipynb notebook in Jupyter to run the genetic algorithm. The notebook includes detailed explanations and visualizations to help understand the process.
```bash
jupyter notebook code.ipynb
